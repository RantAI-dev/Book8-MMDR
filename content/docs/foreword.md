In the rapidly advancing world of technology, the landscape of data management is undergoing a significant transformation. As systems grow increasingly complex, the need for flexible, efficient, and scalable data management solutions has become more critical than ever. When my students at the Mathematics faculty of the University of Indonesia began exploring the challenges and opportunities presented by modern data systems, they quickly found themselves immersed in a dynamic and evolving field. One day, they asked me what the most crucial aspect of todayâ€™s data management landscape was. My response was clear: understanding the power of multi-model databases, and the ability to handle diverse data types within a unified system is essential.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Their next question was equally thought-provoking: "What programming language should we use to explore and implement these concepts?" Without hesitation, I recommended Rust. While other languages, such as Python and Java, have traditionally dominated the field of data management, Rust offers unique advantages that make it particularly well-suited for developing high-performance, reliable multi-model databases. Rustâ€™s emphasis on memory safety, concurrency, and performance optimization allows for the creation of scalable and efficient data management solutions that can handle the rigorous demands of modern applications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I recognize that Rust is still emerging as a dominant force in the data management community, especially compared to more established languages. However, the potential of Rust to revolutionize this field is vast. At RantAI, they are dedicated to leveraging Rustâ€™s growing ecosystem, particularly its specialized crates for data management, to build systems that are not only robust and efficient but also push the boundaries of what is possible in data management. Our vision is to position Rust as a leading choice for developers who seek the benefits of cutting-edge language features combined with the precision and control needed for advanced data management solutions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The study of multi-model databases is fundamentally about understanding how to integrate and manage various data models within a single platform, allowing for greater flexibility and efficiency in data storage, retrieval, and analysis. With the advent of powerful tools and frameworks, the practical implementation of these concepts has become more accessible, enabling developers to focus on core architectural principles without being hindered by the complexities of coding. This approach makes the exploration of multi-model databases both exciting and approachable, encouraging learners to delve into the theory while gaining hands-on experience in building and optimizing these systems using Rust.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I hope that <em>MMDR - Multi-Model Databases with Rust</em> will inspire a new generation of students and professionals, not only in computer science but also in related fields like mathematics and data science. These disciplines are crucial for advancing our understanding of data management, and with the right tools and knowledge, I believe that learners will find the journey of mastering multi-model databases both rewarding and transformative. This book is more than just a technical manual; it is an invitation to explore the future of data management through the lens of multi-model databases, using Rust as a powerful tool to unlock new possibilities. I encourage students, educators, and data enthusiasts to embrace this opportunity to learn, innovate, and contribute to the ongoing evolution of data management technology.
