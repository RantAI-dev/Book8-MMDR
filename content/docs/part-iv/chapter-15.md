# **15.1 Cross-Database Query Fundamentals**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
As multi-model databases and hybrid data architectures grow in complexity, cross-database queriesâ€”where data from multiple databases is queried and combinedâ€”become an essential aspect of modern data management. Cross-database queries enable developers to access and manipulate data from different databases simultaneously, allowing for more flexible and scalable solutions, particularly when integrating SQL and NoSQL databases. In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of cross-database querying, the challenges involved, and practical examples of querying across databases like PostgreSQL and SurrealDB.
</p>

## **15.1.1 Introduction to Cross-Database Queries**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Cross-database queries are used when data from different databases or different types of databases needs to be retrieved and processed together. In traditional systems, each database operates independently with its own querying language and data model. However, as applications have evolved, so has the need to bring together disparate data sources to provide comprehensive results. Cross-database queries solve this by allowing developers to perform operations across multiple databases in a seamless manner.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Common Scenarios for Cross-Database Queries</strong>:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Integration</strong>: Large organizations often maintain data in different types of databases (e.g., relational databases like PostgreSQL and document stores like MongoDB or SurrealDB). Cross-database queries allow the data to be combined and analyzed together, providing a unified view.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hybrid Architectures</strong>: Applications built on hybrid architectures, which utilize both SQL and NoSQL databases, need cross-database queries to access structured data from relational databases and unstructured data from NoSQL systems in a single operation.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Polyglot Persistence</strong>: In polyglot systems where different databases are used for different purposes (e.g., a graph database for relationships and a document database for content), cross-database querying allows the system to leverage the strengths of each database while querying them simultaneously.</p>
## **15.1.2 Basic Techniques for Querying Across Databases**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To perform cross-database queries, developers need to use techniques that allow for querying different types of databases and combining the results. These techniques often involve middleware, database connectors, or APIs that bridge the gap between SQL and NoSQL systems.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Database Connectors and APIs</strong>: Modern databases provide APIs and connectors that allow them to interact with other databases. For instance, SurrealDB provides RESTful APIs, which can be used alongside PostgreSQLâ€™s standard SQL interface to create cross-database queries.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SQL with Foreign Data Wrappers (FDW)</strong>: PostgreSQL supports the use of Foreign Data Wrappers (FDWs), which allow it to query external data sources, including NoSQL databases like SurrealDB. This method allows PostgreSQL to act as a bridge between itself and other databases, enabling SQL queries to fetch data from both systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of setting up a Foreign Data Wrapper in PostgreSQL:
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
  CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgres_fdw;
  
  -- Create a foreign server for SurrealDB
  CREATE SERVER surrealdb_server
    FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw
    OPTIONS (host 'surrealdb_host', port '8000');
  
  -- Create a user mapping for the SurrealDB connection
  CREATE USER MAPPING FOR current_user
    SERVER surrealdb_server
    OPTIONS (user 'username', password 'password');
  
  -- Import the schema from SurrealDB into PostgreSQL
  IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA public
    FROM SERVER surrealdb_server
    INTO public;
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This setup allows PostgreSQL to treat SurrealDB as a foreign table, enabling cross-database queries using standard SQL syntax.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>REST APIs</strong>: In cases where databases do not natively support cross-database querying, REST APIs can be used to fetch data from different databases. SurrealDB provides a REST API, which allows applications to make HTTP requests to query data. This data can then be combined with results from other databases.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of querying SurrealDB via REST API:
</p>

{{< prism lang="shell" line-numbers="true">}}
  curl -X POST "http://surrealdb_host:8000/sql" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"query": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123"}'
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This query fetches data from SurrealDB, which can then be combined with results from a SQL query executed on PostgreSQL.
</p>

## **15.1.3 Understanding the Complexity of Cross-Database Queries**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Performing cross-database queries introduces several technical challenges and considerations. While querying a single database is straightforward, working across multiple databasesâ€”especially when they follow different models (SQL vs. NoSQL)â€”adds layers of complexity that need to be addressed.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Consistency</strong>: Ensuring consistency across different databases is one of the most significant challenges of cross-database querying. SQL databases like PostgreSQL enforce ACID properties to ensure data consistency, whereas NoSQL databases like SurrealDB may use eventual consistency models, leading to potential discrepancies between data in different systems.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Query Latency</strong>: Cross-database queries often involve network communication between different database servers, which can introduce significant latency. This is particularly true if the databases are distributed across different geographical locations or data centers.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Syntax Differences</strong>: SQL and NoSQL databases use different query languages and syntaxes, making it difficult to directly translate queries from one system to another. This requires careful planning to ensure that queries are structured properly for each database.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Handling Heterogeneous Data</strong>: Relational databases store structured data in tables with fixed schemas, while NoSQL databases like SurrealDB may store unstructured or semi-structured data. Combining these different types of data into a unified query result requires mapping fields between different data models and handling schema flexibility in NoSQL databases.</p>
## **15.1.4 Simple Query Examples**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To illustrate the process of cross-database querying, here are simple examples that combine data from PostgreSQL and SurrealDB using SQL joins and API calls.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Example 1: Querying PostgreSQL and SurrealDB with SQL Joins</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we use PostgreSQLâ€™s Foreign Data Wrapper to query data from both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB in a single SQL statement. Assume that PostgreSQL contains customer data, and SurrealDB contains order data.
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
-- Query to fetch customer details from PostgreSQL and order details from SurrealDB
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.order_total
FROM customers c
JOIN surrealdb_orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_id = 123;
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this query, data from the <code>customers</code> table in PostgreSQL is joined with the <code>surrealdb_orders</code> table in SurrealDB, allowing the system to combine the data into a single result set.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Example 2: Using REST APIs to Combine PostgreSQL and SurrealDB Data</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, we use REST APIs to query data from SurrealDB and then combine it with PostgreSQL data in the application layer.
</p>

1. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Query SurrealDB for Order Data<strong></strong>:</p>
{{< prism lang="shell" line-numbers="true">}}
   curl -X POST "http://surrealdb_host:8000/sql" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"query": "SELECT order_id, order_total FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123"}'
   
{{< /prism >}}
2. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Query PostgreSQL for Customer Data<strong></strong>:</p>
{{< prism lang="sql">}}
   SELECT customer_name FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 123;
   
{{< /prism >}}
3. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Combine the Results<strong></strong>: After retrieving the data from both SurrealDB and PostgreSQL, the application layer combines the results, displaying customer details alongside order information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This method allows applications to make use of the strengths of both databases, providing a more flexible and scalable solution without compromising on data consistency or performance.
</p>

# **15.2 Query Optimization Strategies**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Cross-database queries introduce additional complexities in performance optimization, as they involve multiple systems, potentially distributed over networks with varying performance characteristics. Without proper optimization, these queries can suffer from bottlenecks, leading to high latency and reduced throughput. In this section, we will examine common performance bottlenecks encountered in cross-database queries, explore optimization techniques to mitigate these issues, and provide practical steps for implementing query optimizations in hybrid environments using databases like PostgreSQL and SurrealDB.
</p>

## **15.2.1 Performance Bottlenecks in Cross-Database Queries**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When querying across databases, several performance bottlenecks can arise due to the distributed nature of the systems, varying database architectures, and the complexity of the query. The most common bottlenecks include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Network Latency</strong>: Cross-database queries often require data to be fetched from multiple servers, potentially located in different geographical regions or data centers. The time it takes for a query to travel across the network can significantly impact query performance. Network latency is especially problematic for real-time applications where low-latency responses are critical.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Impact</strong>: High latency leads to slower query execution times, especially in cases where multiple round trips between databases are required to complete the query.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Inefficient Joins</strong>: When querying data across different databases, joining tables from separate systems can be inefficient, particularly if one system is relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) and the other is NoSQL (e.g., SurrealDB). Cross-database joins often require data to be pulled into memory, resulting in high memory consumption and longer execution times.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Impact</strong>: Inefficient joins can degrade performance by consuming excessive resources (e.g., CPU, memory), and they may cause delays in query execution due to large data transfers between databases.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Serialization/Deserialization Overhead</strong>: Transferring data between different database systems typically requires converting the data into formats that can be understood by each system (e.g., JSON for NoSQL databases and SQL for relational databases). This process introduces additional overhead and can slow down query execution.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Impact</strong>: The process of serializing and deserializing data can increase both query latency and CPU usage, particularly when dealing with large datasets.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Locking and Transaction Management</strong>: When querying across multiple databases, transaction management and locking mechanisms may behave differently, leading to bottlenecks, especially when the databases have differing consistency models (e.g., strong consistency in PostgreSQL vs. eventual consistency in SurrealDB).</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Impact</strong>: Transaction coordination across databases may introduce delays or deadlocks, further reducing the efficiency of cross-database queries.</p>
## **15.2.2 Optimization Techniques**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To overcome the bottlenecks mentioned above, several advanced optimization strategies can be employed to improve the performance of cross-database queries. These strategies focus on minimizing the overhead introduced by querying multiple systems and ensuring efficient data retrieval.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Query Caching</strong>: Caching frequently executed cross-database queries can significantly reduce latency by avoiding repeated execution of complex queries. Caching can be implemented at multiple levels, such as database query caches, application-level caches, or using an external caching layer like Redis.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Implementation</strong>: Query caching can store the results of frequently run cross-database queries and return cached results instead of re-executing the query across databases. This is particularly effective for read-heavy workloads where the underlying data changes infrequently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of setting up query caching using Redis:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
  import redis
  
  cache = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)
  
  # Function to check cache before querying
  def get_query_results(query):
      cached_result = cache.get(query)
      if cached_result:
          return cached_result
      else:
          # Execute the cross-database query if not cached
          result = execute_cross_database_query(query)
          cache.set(query, result)
          return result
  
{{< /prism >}}
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Indexing</strong>: Proper indexing is crucial for optimizing queries, particularly when performing joins across multiple databases. Indexes enable fast lookups and reduce the amount of data scanned during query execution. In cross-database environments, itâ€™s essential to ensure that the indexed fields are used in joins or filtering conditions to maximize performance.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Implementation</strong>: In PostgreSQL, create indexes on the columns frequently used in joins or where clauses when querying external data sources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql">}}
  CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON customers (customer_id);
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Similarly, indexes in NoSQL systems like SurrealDB can be created on fields used frequently in queries:
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql">}}
  CREATE INDEX idx_order_customer ON orders (customer_id);
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
These indexes help speed up cross-database joins by enabling faster lookups in both databases.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Prefetching</strong>: Data prefetching involves retrieving necessary data from the secondary database (e.g., SurrealDB) before executing the full query, reducing the number of round trips and minimizing network latency. By prefetching data into the application layer or an intermediary cache, the need for repeated network communication is eliminated.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Implementation</strong>: Prefetching can be done by fetching commonly used or related data in advance and storing it temporarily, so that subsequent queries can operate on local data instead of making additional requests to the secondary database.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="shell" line-numbers="true">}}
  # Prefetch order data from SurrealDB
  orders_data = surrealdb_query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123")
  
  # Use the prefetched data in subsequent queries
  for order in orders_data:
      # Perform operations locally without fetching data again
      process_order(order)
  
{{< /prism >}}
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reducing Data Transfer Size</strong>: When transferring data between databases, minimize the amount of data transferred by only selecting the fields that are needed. Instead of performing broad SELECT \* queries, explicitly list the required columns to reduce the data size, thereby reducing network latency and query execution time.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Implementation</strong>: Modify queries to only retrieve essential columns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql">}}
  SELECT customer_id, order_total FROM surrealdb_orders WHERE customer_id = 123;
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This optimization reduces the load on both the network and the databases involved by eliminating unnecessary data from the query result.
</p>

## **15.2.3 Implementing Query Optimization**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To achieve optimal performance in cross-database queries, a systematic approach to optimization is needed. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to implement query optimizations for cross-database environments involving PostgreSQL and SurrealDB.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 1: Profile Your Queries</strong> Begin by profiling your cross-database queries to identify slow or inefficient queries. Use tools like PostgreSQLâ€™s <code>EXPLAIN</code> to analyze query plans and see which parts of the query are causing delays.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of using <code>EXPLAIN</code> to profile a query:
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
EXPLAIN SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_total
FROM customers c
JOIN surrealdb_orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_id = 123;
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The output will provide insight into how the query is executed, allowing you to pinpoint areas where optimizations can be made (e.g., missing indexes, inefficient joins).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 2: Optimize the Join Strategy</strong> If your query involves joining data from PostgreSQL and SurrealDB, ensure that the join conditions are optimized. As discussed earlier, indexing the fields used in the join condition can significantly reduce query execution time.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Index both <code>customer_id</code> in the PostgreSQL <code>customers</code> table and <code>customer_id</code> in the SurrealDB <code>orders</code> table.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">If possible, push down filtering conditions to reduce the amount of data being transferred and joined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 3: Leverage Query Caching</strong> Once youâ€™ve optimized the query itself, implement query caching to store frequently queried results. This reduces the need to re-execute the same cross-database query repeatedly and improves performance in read-heavy scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of setting up query caching:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Use an external caching system like Redis to store results from common cross-database queries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example Redis setup in a Python application:
</p>

{{< prism lang="">}}
  cache = redis.Redis()
  
  def get_cached_result(query):
      # Check if query result is cached
      cached_result = cache.get(query)
      if cached_result:
          return cached_result
      else:
          result = execute_cross_database_query(query)
          cache.set(query, result)
          return result
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 4: Optimize Data Transfers</strong> Reduce data transfer sizes by explicitly selecting only the fields you need. This reduces the load on the network and speeds up query execution.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
-- Instead of this
SELECT * FROM surrealdb_orders WHERE customer_id = 123;

-- Use this
SELECT order_id, order_total FROM surrealdb_orders WHERE customer_id = 123;
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 5: Monitor Query Performance</strong> After applying optimizations, continuously monitor query performance to ensure that the changes have the desired effect. Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track query latency, resource usage, and overall performance metrics.
</p>

# **15.3 Middleware Solutions for Query Federation**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Query federation enables developers to query data across multiple databases seamlessly, as though they were interacting with a single unified system. This capability is particularly useful in multi-model architectures where data is stored in both SQL and NoSQL databases. Middleware solutions for query federation play a crucial role in abstracting the complexity of managing multiple databases, allowing for cross-database queries without needing to manually handle each systemâ€™s quirks. In this section, we will explore the role of middleware in query federation, discuss the benefits and limitations of using middleware, and provide practical steps for setting up middleware solutions to enable efficient cross-database queries.
</p>

## **15.3.1 Role of Middleware in Query Federation**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Middleware acts as an intermediary layer that sits between the application and the underlying databases, abstracting the details of each database and providing a unified query interface. By handling communication with different databases, middleware enables cross-database queries without requiring the application to interact with each database separately. This simplifies querying multiple databases, particularly when dealing with systems that have different query languages and data models, such as SQL-based systems like PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases like SurrealDB.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>How Middleware Works in Query Federation</strong>:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Query Translation</strong>: Middleware translates queries from a common query language (usually SQL or an extended form of SQL) into the specific query languages used by the underlying databases. This allows developers to write queries in one format, which the middleware then adapts for each target database.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Aggregation</strong>: Middleware can aggregate results from multiple databases, combining the data into a single response that is returned to the application. This aggregation allows for cross-database joins, unions, and other operations to be performed, even when the underlying databases are independent of each other.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Load Balancing and Fault Tolerance</strong>: In addition to query translation and aggregation, middleware can handle load balancing across different database instances, ensuring that queries are distributed efficiently to avoid overloading any single database. Some middleware solutions also offer fault tolerance, automatically redirecting queries to a backup database if the primary one becomes unavailable.</p>
## **15.3.2 Benefits and Drawbacks of Middleware**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Middleware provides several advantages when integrating multiple databases, but it also comes with certain limitations. Understanding the trade-offs is essential for deciding whether to implement middleware in a cross-database architecture.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Benefits of Middleware</strong>:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Unified Query Interface</strong>: Middleware provides a single point of interaction for the application, abstracting the complexities of querying different databases. This simplifies development, as developers only need to write one type of query instead of learning multiple database query languages.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Federation</strong>: Middleware enables true query federation, allowing for complex operations like joins, unions, and aggregations to be performed across databases. This allows applications to integrate and analyze data from disparate sources without requiring manual data merging.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Simplified Management</strong>: Since middleware handles communication with each database, it reduces the burden on developers to manage connections, authentication, and query optimizations for each database individually.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Scalability</strong>: Middleware can distribute query workloads across multiple database instances, improving scalability. This is especially useful for high-availability systems that require data to be replicated across different locations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Drawbacks of Middleware</strong>:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Performance Overhead</strong>: Middleware introduces an additional layer between the application and the databases, which can add latency to queries. Depending on the complexity of the query and the middleware implementation, this overhead can become significant, especially for large-scale queries.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Limited Query Flexibility</strong>: While middleware provides a unified query interface, it may not support all the advanced features of each underlying database. For instance, middleware might limit access to certain NoSQL-specific operations or advanced SQL features, making it less flexible for specialized use cases.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Consistency Challenges</strong>: Middleware must ensure that data remains consistent across multiple databases, which can be difficult if the databases have different consistency models (e.g., PostgreSQLâ€™s ACID transactions vs. SurrealDBâ€™s eventual consistency). This can lead to challenges in maintaining data accuracy, especially in distributed systems.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Complex Configuration</strong>: Setting up and configuring middleware solutions can be complex, requiring detailed knowledge of each underlying database as well as the middleware itself. This can increase the initial development time and create additional maintenance overhead.</p>
## **15.3.3 Setting Up Middleware for Query Federation**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing middleware for query federation requires configuring the middleware to communicate with each database, ensuring that queries can be translated and executed across systems. Below are the steps to set up middleware for enabling cross-database queries.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 1: Choose the Right Middleware Solution</strong> There are several middleware solutions available for query federation, each with different strengths and focuses. Popular options include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Presto/Trino</strong>: A distributed SQL query engine that supports querying data from multiple databases, including relational and NoSQL systems. Presto is designed for fast analytic queries and can handle data federation across large clusters.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Apache Drill</strong>: A schema-free SQL query engine that supports querying data from various sources, including NoSQL databases, file systems, and relational databases. It provides flexibility in dealing with both structured and semi-structured data.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dremio</strong>: A data lake engine that simplifies data access by providing a unified query interface across multiple databases, including cloud storage and NoSQL systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 2: Configure Middleware for Each Database</strong> Once youâ€™ve chosen a middleware solution, the next step is to configure the middleware to connect to each database. This involves setting up the appropriate connectors or drivers for PostgreSQL, SurrealDB, and any other databases in use.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Example: Configuring Trino for PostgreSQL and SurrealDB</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Install Trino</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, install Trino and ensure that itâ€™s properly set up to run queries.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Configure the PostgreSQL Connector</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Add the following configuration to Trino for the PostgreSQL connector:</p>
{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
connector.name=postgresql
connection-url=jdbc:postgresql://<postgresql-host>:5432/database
connection-user=username
connection-password=password
{{< /prism >}}

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Configure the SurrealDB Connector</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If SurrealDB does not have a dedicated Trino connector, consider using a custom connector or interacting with SurrealDB through the REST API. Ensure network access and permissions are configured to allow Trino to query SurrealDB data as needed.</p>
{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
   connector.name=rest
   connection-url=http://<surrealdb-host>:8000
   connection-user=username
   connection-password=password
   
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, Trino is configured to connect to both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB. The middleware will translate and execute queries across both databases.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 3: Write Cross-Database Queries</strong> With the middleware in place, you can write SQL queries that fetch and combine data from multiple databases. Middleware like Trino allows you to write a single query that interacts with both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of a cross-database query using Trino:
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id, orders.total_amount
FROM postgresql.customers
JOIN surrealdb.orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
WHERE customers.country = 'USA';
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this query, data from the <code>customers</code> table in PostgreSQL is joined with data from the <code>orders</code> table in SurrealDB. Trino handles the underlying query translation and execution, returning a unified result to the application.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 4: Optimize Query Performance</strong> To improve the performance of cross-database queries, apply optimization techniques such as:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Query Caching</strong>: Cache frequently executed queries to reduce the load on the databases and speed up query execution.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Indexing</strong>: Ensure that both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB have appropriate indexes on the columns used in the query, particularly for join conditions.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Partitioning</strong>: If querying large datasets, consider partitioning the data across multiple database instances to improve query speed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 5: Monitor and Adjust Middleware Performance</strong> After deploying the middleware, monitor its performance to identify any bottlenecks. Middleware solutions often come with built-in performance monitoring tools, allowing you to track query latency, resource usage, and load distribution.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example: Using Trinoâ€™s built-in query monitor to analyze performance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="shell">}}
trino-cli --execute "SHOW PROCESSLIST"

# **15.4 Virtual Database Techniques**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In multi-database architectures, managing queries across multiple databases can be complex, especially when combining different types of databases like SQL and NoSQL. Virtual databases provide a solution to this complexity by abstracting multiple underlying databases into a single unified data model. This abstraction allows developers to query disparate databases using a common interface without needing to worry about the specific query languages or data models of each system. In this section, we will explore the concept of virtual databases, discuss how they simplify query processes, and provide practical steps to build a virtual database that spans across systems like PostgreSQL and SurrealDB.
</p>

## **15.4.1 Concept of Virtual Databases**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A <strong>virtual database</strong> is a logical abstraction that unifies multiple databases into a single interface, allowing users to query them as if they were querying a single database. Unlike traditional databases, virtual databases do not store data themselves; instead, they fetch data from the underlying databases in real time. This abstraction layer manages the complexity of different database types (e.g., SQL vs. NoSQL), query languages, and data models, making it easier to integrate data from multiple sources.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Key Features of Virtual Databases</strong>:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Unified Query Language</strong>: Virtual databases provide a unified query interface (typically SQL-based) that allows developers to access data from multiple underlying databases using a single query language, regardless of whether the databases are relational (like PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (like SurrealDB).</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dynamic Data Integration</strong>: Instead of storing data, a virtual database dynamically retrieves and combines data from multiple sources. This allows for real-time data integration across different databases without the need to replicate data.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Federation</strong>: Virtual databases support data federation, allowing for distributed queries across different databases. The system fetches data from each database as needed, processes the results, and returns a unified response to the application.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Query Optimization</strong>: Advanced virtual database platforms can optimize queries across multiple databases by pushing down operations (such as filtering or aggregating) to the underlying databases, reducing the amount of data transferred and improving performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Virtual databases are especially useful in environments where data is distributed across multiple databases or data stores, such as in multi-model or hybrid architectures. By abstracting the differences between databases, virtual databases simplify data access and reduce the complexity of managing multiple systems.
</p>

## **15.4.2 Implementing Virtual Databases for Unified Queries**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Virtual databases provide a unified querying experience across multiple databases, simplifying data access and integration. Implementing a virtual database involves several steps, including selecting the appropriate software, configuring connectors for each underlying database, and optimizing the virtual database for performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>How Virtual Databases Simplify Query Processes</strong>:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Eliminating Redundancy</strong>: Without a virtual database, developers often need to write separate queries for each database, process the results manually, and combine them in the application layer. Virtual databases eliminate this redundancy by allowing a single query to be executed across multiple systems.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improving Data Accessibility</strong>: Virtual databases provide a single point of access to all underlying databases, making it easier for developers to retrieve data from multiple sources. This improves the accessibility of data stored in disparate systems and allows for more comprehensive data analysis.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Real-Time Data Access</strong>: Since virtual databases query the underlying databases in real time, users always have access to the most up-to-date data without needing to synchronize or replicate data between systems. This is particularly useful for applications where data freshness is critical, such as real-time reporting or monitoring systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Virtual databases also simplify the handling of data stored in different formats. For example, a relational database like PostgreSQL may store structured data in tables, while a NoSQL system like SurrealDB may store unstructured or semi-structured data in documents. The virtual database abstracts these differences, allowing developers to query both systems in a consistent manner.
</p>

## **15.4.3 Building a Virtual Database**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To create a virtual database that spans systems like PostgreSQL and SurrealDB, you need to configure a virtual database platform and set up the necessary connectors to each database. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to build a virtual database using popular software and tools.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 1: Choose a Virtual Database Platform</strong> There are several virtual database platforms available that can integrate different databases into a unified query interface. Some popular options include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dremio</strong>: A data lake engine that supports SQL-based querying across multiple data sources, including relational databases and NoSQL databases.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Denodo</strong>: A data virtualization platform that provides a unified interface to access data from different types of databases and data sources.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Presto/Trino</strong>: A distributed SQL query engine that supports data federation across multiple databases, allowing for queries to be executed in real time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For this example, we will use <strong>Dremio</strong> to build a virtual database that spans PostgreSQL and SurrealDB.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 2: Install and Configure Dremio</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Install Dremio</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Download and install Dremio on your server or local machine.</p>
{{< prism lang="shell" line-numbers="true">}}
# Example command to install Dremio
wget https://download.dremio.com/community-server/dremio-community-latest.tar.gz
tar -xvzf dremio-community-latest.tar.gz
cd dremio
./bin/dremio start
{{< /prism >}}

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Access the Dremio UI</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once Dremio is installed and running, access the Dremio web interface via <code>http://localhost:9047</code> to configure your virtual database.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Connect to PostgreSQL and SurrealDB</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the Dremio UI, configure connections to both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB. Add each as a data source to allow queries across both databases.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Add a PostgreSQL Data Source</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the Dremio UI, add PostgreSQL as a data source by providing the necessary connection details (e.g., hostname, database name, username, and password).</p>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Navigate to the <strong>Sources</strong> tab and click <strong>New Source</strong>.</li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Select <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> and fill in the required connection information.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Add a SurrealDB Data Source</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To connect to SurrealDB, you may need to configure a custom connector if Dremio does not have a built-in connector for SurrealDB. You can use the REST API to interact with SurrealDB from Dremio.</p>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Navigate to the <strong>Sources</strong> tab and click <strong>New Source</strong>.</li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Select <strong>HTTP</strong> as the source type and configure it to point to SurrealDBâ€™s REST API endpoint.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Test the Connections</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB are connected, you can test the connections by running a simple query against each database. This ensures that the virtual database can access both systems.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. Create Virtual Datasets</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Dremio, you can create virtual datasets by combining data from different data sources. These datasets are treated as virtual tables that can be queried using SQL.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Create a Virtual Dataset</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Create a virtual dataset by writing a query that pulls data from both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB.</p>
{{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
SELECT p.customer_name, o.order_id, o.order_total
FROM postgresql.customers p
JOIN surrealdb.orders o ON p.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE p.region = 'North America';
{{< /prism >}}

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Save the Virtual Dataset</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the query is executed successfully, save the dataset as a virtual table within Dremio. This dataset can now be queried like any other table.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Optimize Query Performance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To ensure that the virtual database performs efficiently, apply the following optimization techniques:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Use indexing on frequently queried columns in both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB to improve join performance.</li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Limit the data returned by filtering on specific regions or timeframes to reduce query load.</li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Use Dremioâ€™s query profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and adjust the query structure as needed.</li>
</ul>


- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Indexing</strong>: Ensure that the underlying databases (PostgreSQL and SurrealDB) have appropriate indexes on the fields used in the queries, particularly join conditions.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Partitioning</strong>: If querying large datasets, consider partitioning the data across multiple nodes to improve query performance.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Query Caching</strong>: Enable query caching in Dremio to store the results of frequently executed queries, reducing the need to fetch the same data repeatedly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Step 6: Execute Cross-Database Queries</strong> With the virtual database set up, you can now execute cross-database queries that combine data from PostgreSQL and SurrealDB using Dremioâ€™s SQL interface.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example query:
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.order_total
FROM postgresql.customers c
JOIN surrealdb.orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_status = 'Active';
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Dremio will handle the underlying data retrieval and query translation, presenting a unified result to the user.
</p>

# **15.5 Case Studies and Real-World Applications**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Advanced query techniques in cross-database systems have transformed how modern applications access and integrate data across multiple databases. Real-world implementations of these techniques showcase how enterprises have successfully overcome the challenges of data integration, scalability, and performance optimization. This section explores case studies that highlight the successful implementation of cross-database querying in real-world scenarios, the lessons learned from these implementations, and the impact on application performance and data retrieval.
</p>

## **15.5.1 Successful Implementations of Cross-Database Query Techniques**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Several organizations have successfully implemented advanced cross-database querying techniques to improve data accessibility and operational efficiency. These case studies demonstrate how hybrid data architectures and multi-model databases, such as PostgreSQL and SurrealDB, have been leveraged to address specific business needs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Case Study 1: Cross-Database Querying for E-commerce Analytics</strong> An e-commerce company needed to integrate real-time transactional data from its relational PostgreSQL database with unstructured customer behavior data stored in SurrealDB. The company implemented a virtual database solution using Dremio, which allowed them to query both databases simultaneously and generate comprehensive customer analytics reports.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Key Strategy</strong>: By utilizing a virtual database, the company was able to create a unified data model that combined customer purchase history from PostgreSQL with website interaction data from SurrealDB. The virtual database enabled the company to perform cross-database joins and aggregations, offering deeper insights into customer behavior and purchase patterns.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Outcome</strong>: The implementation led to a 30% improvement in data retrieval times and provided the marketing team with real-time customer insights, allowing them to personalize marketing efforts and improve customer retention.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Case Study 2: Healthcare Data Integration</strong> A healthcare provider faced the challenge of integrating patient records stored in a traditional relational database (PostgreSQL) with medical imaging data stored in a NoSQL document store. By using middleware to facilitate query federation, the healthcare provider was able to bridge the gap between structured and unstructured data.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Key Strategy</strong>: The healthcare provider implemented a middleware solution that enabled them to query patient records from PostgreSQL while simultaneously accessing medical imaging metadata stored in a NoSQL database. This allowed medical professionals to query both patient records and imaging data in one unified query.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Outcome</strong>: The healthcare provider significantly reduced the time required to retrieve patient data, improving clinical decision-making and enabling faster diagnostics. Query execution times were reduced by 40%, leading to more efficient hospital workflows.</p>
## **15.5.2 Lessons Learned from Industry**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
From these real-world implementations, several important lessons and best practices have emerged for successfully implementing cross-database querying in large-scale systems:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 1: Simplification through Virtualization</strong>: Virtual databases and middleware solutions simplify the process of querying across multiple databases, abstracting away the complexities of managing different query languages and data models. In both case studies, virtual databases and middleware allowed teams to seamlessly integrate data from SQL and NoSQL systems without requiring complex manual integration efforts.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 2: Importance of Indexing and Optimization</strong>: In systems that require frequent cross-database queries, optimizing database performance through indexing is critical. Both case studies highlighted the importance of proper indexing on key fields used in cross-database joins, which led to significant improvements in query execution times. Database optimization techniques, such as query caching and data partitioning, also played a role in enhancing performance.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 3: Real-Time Data Integration</strong>: For applications requiring real-time data access, such as e-commerce analytics and healthcare systems, cross-database queries must be optimized for low-latency performance. Middleware solutions that provide real-time query translation and aggregation can enable real-time data access without compromising on performance. In the e-commerce case study, the virtual database's ability to aggregate real-time transactional and behavioral data was a key factor in delivering timely insights.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 4: Balancing Data Consistency with Performance</strong>: When integrating databases with different consistency models (e.g., PostgreSQLâ€™s strong consistency vs. SurrealDBâ€™s eventual consistency), it is important to carefully balance consistency requirements with performance goals. In both case studies, organizations opted for eventual consistency in certain parts of the system to achieve better performance while maintaining strict consistency where necessary (e.g., in transactional data).</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lesson 5: Scalability through Distributed Queries</strong>: In scenarios where data is distributed across multiple systems, the ability to scale queries horizontally across databases is critical for maintaining performance under load. Middleware solutions, such as Dremio or Apache Drill, enabled distributed query execution across PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases, allowing both companies to scale their data retrieval processes as the volume of data increased.</p>
## **15.5.3 Analyzing Case Studies: Detailed Lessons and Insights**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By analyzing these case studies in greater depth, we can extract valuable insights and identify the specific technical decisions that led to success. Each case study provided unique solutions to the challenges of cross-database querying, data integration, and performance optimization.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Technical Insight 1: Cross-Database Joins and Aggregations</strong> In the e-commerce case study, one of the biggest technical challenges was performing cross-database joins between structured transactional data in PostgreSQL and unstructured data in SurrealDB. By using a virtual database, the company was able to perform cross-database joins efficiently, even though the underlying databases had different query languages and data models. This allowed the company to execute complex SQL queries that combined data from both databases, without having to manually fetch and merge the data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Example Query</strong>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
SELECT p.customer_name, o.order_id, o.total_amount
FROM postgresql.customers p
JOIN surrealdb.orders o ON p.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This query joins the <code>customers</code> table from PostgreSQL with the <code>orders</code> table from SurrealDB, enabling the company to retrieve customer purchase data and behavior insights in a single query.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Technical Insight 2: Real-Time Query Optimization</strong> In both case studies, real-time data access was a critical requirement. Query caching and data prefetching techniques were used to optimize query performance, particularly in high-traffic environments. Caching frequently executed queries allowed both organizations to reduce query latency, while data prefetching ensured that the most relevant data was always available when needed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Example of Query Caching Implementation</strong>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="">}}
import redis

cache = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)

def get_cached_query(query):
    cached_result = cache.get(query)
    if cached_result:
        return cached_result
    else:
        # Execute the cross-database query
        result = execute_query(query)
        cache.set(query, result)
        return result
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This caching mechanism reduced the time needed to fetch frequently queried data, improving both response times and overall system performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Technical Insight 3: Middleware Configuration and Optimization</strong> In the healthcare case study, the use of middleware to federate queries across PostgreSQL and a NoSQL database allowed the healthcare provider to simplify data retrieval. However, middleware configuration and optimization were crucial to ensuring that the system could handle large-scale queries without introducing significant latency. Middleware solutions like Dremio and Denodo were configured to optimize data transfers between databases, with performance tuning applied to handle peak loads in real-time.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Example Middleware Configuration for Optimizing Data Retrieval</strong>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
[middleware]
enable_query_caching=true
max_concurrent_queries=50
connection_timeout=10
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By configuring the middleware to cache queries and manage concurrent queries effectively, the healthcare provider was able to optimize system performance and minimize the risk of bottlenecks during high-demand periods.
