# 13.1 Understanding the Need for Hybrid Architectures
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the evolving landscape of data management, hybrid database architectures have emerged as a compelling solution to meet diverse and complex requirements. This section explores the rationale behind adopting hybrid architectures, focusing on the interplay between PostgreSQL and SurrealDB, and outlines practical considerations and real-world implementations.
</p>

## 13.1.1 Overview of Hybrid Database Systems
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hybrid database systems integrate multiple database technologies to leverage the strengths of each while mitigating their individual limitations. This approach enables organizations to handle varied data types and workloads more effectively than relying on a single database solution. Hybrid architectures combine capabilities such as:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Document Storage</strong>: Managing semi-structured or unstructured data.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Relational Databases</strong>: Handling structured data with complex querying requirements.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Graph Databases</strong>: Representing and querying complex relationships.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The necessity for hybrid systems arises from the need to address the diverse data management requirements that modern applications demand. For instance, applications that handle both transactional and analytical workloads may benefit from integrating OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems.
</p>

## 13.1.2 Strengths and Limitations of PostgreSQL and SurrealDB
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>PostgreSQL</strong> is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its robust support for complex queries, ACID compliance, and extensibility. Its strengths include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advanced Query Capabilities</strong>: Supports SQL with advanced features for querying and indexing.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Strong Data Integrity</strong>: Ensures ACID compliance for reliable transaction processing.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Extensibility</strong>: Provides support for custom functions, types, and indexing methods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, PostgreSQL has limitations in handling certain non-relational data types and scaling horizontally in distributed environments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>SurrealDB</strong> is a modern multi-model database that integrates document, graph, and relational models. Its strengths include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Flexible Data Models</strong>: Supports diverse data types and relationships within a single database.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Scalability</strong>: Designed for horizontal scaling and distributed architectures.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Schema Flexibility</strong>: Allows schema-less and schema-full operations for adaptability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
SurrealDBâ€™s limitations include a newer, less mature ecosystem compared to PostgreSQL and potential challenges in advanced SQL querying and transactional consistency.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By combining PostgreSQL and SurrealDB, organizations can leverage the relational strengths of PostgreSQL and the flexibility and scalability of SurrealDB, addressing a broader range of use cases.
</p>

## 13.1.3 When to Use Hybrid Architectures
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hybrid architectures become advantageous in scenarios where single-database solutions fall short. Consider the following situations:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Diverse Data Requirements</strong>: Applications needing to manage structured data, semi-structured documents, and complex relationships benefit from combining relational and multi-model databases.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Scalability Needs</strong>: When high scalability is essential, integrating a horizontally scalable database like SurrealDB with PostgreSQL can address both high transaction volumes and complex analytical queries.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Operational Efficiency</strong>: For applications with distinct workload types (e.g., OLTP vs. OLAP), hybrid systems can optimize performance and resource utilization by delegating specific tasks to the most suitable database technology.</p>
## 13.1.4 Design Considerations for Hybrid Systems
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Designing hybrid database systems requires careful planning to ensure seamless integration and effective performance. Key considerations include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Distribution</strong>: Determine how data will be distributed across different databases and how to synchronize it. This involves defining data partitioning strategies and consistency models.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Consistency and Latency</strong>: Address how to maintain data consistency across databases, especially in distributed environments. Consider eventual consistency models and latency impacts on performance.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Integration Mechanisms</strong>: Choose integration tools and strategies for data flow between databases, including data replication, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and API-based communication.</p>
## 13.1.5 Case Studies of Hybrid Implementations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Examining real-world case studies can provide insights into the practical application of hybrid database architectures. Notable examples include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>E-Commerce Platforms</strong>: Integrating PostgreSQL for transactional data and SurrealDB for product catalog and user interaction management to balance transaction processing with flexible data handling.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Social Media Analytics</strong>: Using PostgreSQL for structured user data and SurrealDB for dynamic social interactions and relationship mapping, improving both data analysis and scalability.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Financial Services</strong>: Combining PostgreSQLâ€™s robustness for financial transactions with SurrealDBâ€™s ability to handle diverse financial products and customer data, enhancing both performance and adaptability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, understanding the need for hybrid architectures involves recognizing the unique strengths and limitations of different database systems, evaluating scenarios where a hybrid approach offers advantages, and considering key design aspects. Real-world case studies illustrate how these principles are applied in practice, offering valuable insights for implementing effective hybrid database solutions.
</p>

# 13.2 Designing the Hybrid Architecture
## 13.2.1 Core Architectural Patterns
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In hybrid database architectures, choosing the right architectural pattern is foundational to successfully integrating multiple databases. One of the most commonly employed patterns is <strong>polyglot persistence</strong>, which refers to the practice of using different types of databases within the same application to handle diverse data requirements. For example, PostgreSQL, known for its robustness in managing structured, transactional data, is ideal for handling complex queries and ACID-compliant operations. On the other hand, SurrealDB, with its support for document, graph, and relational models, is better suited for applications that require flexibility in managing unstructured or semi-structured data. By using both databases, organizations can maximize the strengths of each, achieving more efficient data processing and management.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another important architectural approach is <strong>data partitioning</strong>, where large datasets are split into smaller, more manageable segments (shards) and distributed across different databases or database instances. This is particularly useful in scenarios requiring scalability, as it allows a system to handle growing data volumes by spreading the load across multiple databases. For instance, relational data in PostgreSQL can be partitioned by user ID or region, while SurrealDB can handle the less structured data, such as user interactions or social network graphs. Combining these two patternsâ€”polyglot persistence and data partitioningâ€”ensures a hybrid architecture that is both scalable and optimized for diverse workloads.
</p>

## 13.2.2 Data Flow and Distribution
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A critical aspect of hybrid database architecture is <strong>data flow and distribution</strong>, which determines how data moves between PostgreSQL and SurrealDB, and how it is stored and retrieved. Effective distribution of data relies on techniques such as <strong>data sharding</strong> and <strong>replication</strong>. Sharding involves dividing data horizontally across multiple instances or databases, ensuring that different pieces of data are stored in different places, but in a way that allows for efficient retrieval when needed. In a hybrid architecture, data that needs to be queried frequently or needs to adhere to a strict schema can be stored in PostgreSQL, while semi-structured or graph-related data can be sharded across SurrealDB instances.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Replication</strong> plays a complementary role, ensuring that critical data is available in multiple locations, improving fault tolerance, and reducing the risk of data loss. By replicating data between PostgreSQL and SurrealDB, you ensure that both databases are synchronized where necessary. For example, a replicated user profile stored in PostgreSQL can be mirrored in SurrealDB to maintain consistency in different parts of the system. However, replication comes with its own set of challenges, particularly around maintaining synchronization between databases with different consistency models.
</p>

## 13.2.3 Handling Data Consistency
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Data consistency is one of the most complex challenges when designing a hybrid architecture. PostgreSQL, being a relational database, offers strong consistency guarantees through <strong>ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)</strong> properties. These guarantees ensure that transactions are processed reliably, even in cases of system failure. SurrealDB, while flexible and capable of handling multiple data models, might adopt <strong>eventual consistency</strong> for distributed scenarios, meaning that updates to the database may not be immediately visible across all nodes but will eventually become consistent.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To ensure consistency across these systems, developers must carefully choose the appropriate strategy. In some cases, <strong>distributed transactions</strong> or <strong>two-phase commit protocols</strong> can be employed to ensure that updates are applied consistently across both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB. However, these techniques can introduce additional latency and complexity. For scenarios where strong consistency is not required, eventual consistency models may be sufficient, particularly for less critical data. <strong>Data synchronization tools or middleware</strong> can also be used to propagate changes between the two databases, ensuring that data remains aligned without sacrificing performance.
</p>

## 13.2.4 Latency and Performance Considerations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When designing a hybrid database system, <strong>latency</strong> and <strong>performance</strong> must be carefully managed. Hybrid architectures introduce additional latency due to the need to coordinate between different databases and potentially across distributed systems. To mitigate this, several strategies can be employed. <strong>Data caching</strong> is an effective way to reduce the need for repeated database queries. By caching frequently accessed data, you can significantly reduce response times and minimize the need for cross-database queries. In-memory caching solutions, such as Redis or Memcached, can be deployed between PostgreSQL and SurrealDB to optimize performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Performance tuning is also crucial. PostgreSQLâ€™s performance can be optimized through <strong>query optimization</strong> and <strong>indexing strategies</strong> tailored to the relational model. SurrealDB, with its flexible schema support, requires different optimization techniques, such as configuring appropriate <strong>indexing</strong> for document and graph queries. Additionally, careful management of <strong>query plans</strong> in PostgreSQL and SurrealDB can help reduce unnecessary computations and improve overall system performance. <strong>Network latency</strong> between databases in a distributed environment should also be considered, as this can become a bottleneck if not properly managed.
</p>

## 13.2.5 Blueprints for Hybrid Architecture
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To visualize how these principles come together, practical blueprints can help illustrate the flow of data and control between PostgreSQL and SurrealDB in a hybrid architecture. In an <strong>e-commerce platform</strong>, for example, PostgreSQL can be used to handle transactional data, such as orders and payments, while SurrealDB manages product catalogs and user-generated content such as reviews and recommendations. Data from the transactional side (PostgreSQL) might be synchronized with SurrealDB to provide dynamic, real-time updates to the catalog or personalized recommendations based on recent purchases.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In a <strong>social media application</strong>, PostgreSQL could store structured data like user profiles, messages, and activity logs, whereas SurrealDB handles more flexible data, like social connections and interaction histories, modeled as graphs. By synchronizing user actions from PostgreSQL to SurrealDB, the system can provide real-time insights into user behavior and interactions, offering rich social graph querying capabilities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Both examples highlight the need for <strong>data integration middleware</strong> that facilitates seamless communication between PostgreSQL and SurrealDB, ensuring that data flows efficiently and remains consistent across the hybrid architecture. These blueprints offer a clear starting point for designing a hybrid system that maximizes the strengths of both databases while addressing the specific needs of diverse, modern applications.
</p>

# 13.3 Data Integration Techniques
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The integration of disparate data models and systems, such as the relational structure of PostgreSQL and the flexible multi-model architecture of SurrealDB, is a crucial challenge in hybrid database architectures. Effective data integration techniques are essential for ensuring seamless communication and coherence between systems. In this section, we explore the fundamental concepts of integrating these data models, discuss how to design schemas that facilitate smooth integration, and provide practical approaches for implementing data pipelines that ensure efficient data movement between PostgreSQL and SurrealDB.
</p>

## 13.3.1 Integrating Data Models
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The first step in creating a robust hybrid database architecture is understanding how to integrate different data models. PostgreSQL is a relational database, built around structured tables, rows, and relationships that are defined by strict schema rules. SurrealDB, on the other hand, is a multi-model database capable of storing and querying document-based data, graph data, and even relational data, but with a more flexible schema approach.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The challenge lies in how these two fundamentally different models can work together. One approach is to map data from one model to the other based on the specific use case. For example, data stored in a table in PostgreSQL may be represented as a document in SurrealDB, with fields in the table corresponding to key-value pairs in the document. For graph data, relationships between records in PostgreSQL tables can be mirrored as edges between nodes in SurrealDB. These integrations often rely on data transformations that make sure the semantics of the data are preserved as it moves between different representations.
</p>

## 13.3.2 Data Mapping and Transformation
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A critical aspect of hybrid database integration is <strong>data mapping and transformation</strong>. This involves translating data from one format or structure to another, making it usable across multiple systems without losing meaning or context. In a hybrid architecture where PostgreSQL and SurrealDB coexist, the challenge is to create effective mappings between PostgreSQLâ€™s structured schema and SurrealDBâ€™s more fluid document and graph representations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Data transformation techniques are often employed to align different data models. For instance, a row in a PostgreSQL table can be transformed into a JSON document in SurrealDB, where the tableâ€™s columns correspond to key-value pairs in the document. Similarly, relationships between rows in a relational table (using foreign keys) can be mapped to graph edges in SurrealDB, preserving the link between entities. Careful attention must be paid to how these transformations are structured, particularly in cases where data types or formats do not directly match, as this can lead to data integrity issues.
</p>

## 13.3.3 Schema Design for Integration
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Designing schemas that facilitate smooth data integration between PostgreSQL and SurrealDB requires careful planning and a deep understanding of how each system stores and manages data. One of the key considerations is how to ensure that the data models in each system are compatible with one another. When designing schemas for integration, it is crucial to decide how much overlap is necessary between the two systems and where redundancy should be minimized.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
PostgreSQLâ€™s schema design is typically well-defined, with strict rules for data types, constraints, and relationships. SurrealDB offers more flexibility, allowing schema-less or schema-optional data models. To integrate these effectively, it is often necessary to adopt a hybrid schema design that accommodates the strictness of PostgreSQL while leveraging the flexibility of SurrealDB where necessary. This might involve using intermediate schemas that facilitate the transformation of data, or creating additional layers of abstraction that allow data to move seamlessly between the two systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For example, if a user profile is stored as a table in PostgreSQL, it might also be stored as a document in SurrealDB, but with additional fields that are not required in the relational model. In such cases, the relational schema must be designed in a way that allows easy transformation into the document format, while ensuring that any critical data is not lost in translation.
</p>

## 13.3.4 Managing Data Redundancy
<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the key challenges in a hybrid architecture is managing data redundancy, where the same data may be stored in different formats across PostgreSQL and SurrealDB. While redundancy can provide performance benefits, such as faster access to frequently queried data in different formats, it can also lead to conflicts if the data becomes unsynchronized between systems. Effective management of redundancy requires establishing rules and processes for ensuring data consistency and avoiding conflicts.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The first step is deciding which system serves as the <strong>source of truth</strong> for any given data. In some cases, PostgreSQL might be the authoritative source for transactional data, while SurrealDB could handle derived or non-critical data. Redundancy can then be managed by syncing critical data between the two systems at regular intervals or in real-time, depending on the use case. <strong>Conflict resolution strategies</strong> must also be put in place to handle cases where the data diverges between systems, ensuring that updates in one system are accurately reflected in the other.
</p>

## 13.3.5 Implementing Data Pipelines
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The final and most practical step in integrating PostgreSQL and SurrealDB is building <strong>data pipelines</strong> that can move and transform data between the two systems. A data pipeline automates the flow of data, ensuring that data is transformed, mapped, and synchronized across the hybrid architecture without manual intervention.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To implement a data pipeline, the first step is to define the source and target systems, identifying which data will be transferred and in what format. For example, an application may require user data from PostgreSQL to be transformed into JSON documents and stored in SurrealDB for faster access by front-end applications. Once the data flow is defined, tools such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes or real-time data streaming technologies like Kafka can be used to implement the pipeline.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The pipeline must handle not only the initial transformation and transfer of data but also ongoing synchronization between PostgreSQL and SurrealDB. For example, changes to a userâ€™s profile in PostgreSQL should automatically propagate to SurrealDB in real-time to ensure consistency. Error handling and retry mechanisms are also essential to ensure that the pipeline remains robust even in the face of network failures or system downtime.
</p>

# 13.4 Querying Across Databases
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In hybrid database architectures, querying across multiple databases like PostgreSQL and SurrealDB becomes a crucial challenge. Managing data stored in different systems while ensuring efficient querying, data consistency, and optimized performance requires a solid understanding of cross-database query techniques. This section explores the fundamentals of querying across databases, techniques for query federation, methods for optimizing cross-database queries, and practical examples of writing and executing these queries.
</p>

## 13.4.1 Cross-Database Query Basics
<p style="text-align: justify;">
At the core of querying across databases is the ability to retrieve and combine data stored in different systems. In hybrid architectures, where PostgreSQL and SurrealDB coexist, it is common for an application to require data from both systems. For example, a query might need to retrieve structured transactional data from PostgreSQL and combine it with unstructured or graph-based data from SurrealDB.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The basic technique for cross-database querying involves two steps: retrieving data from each database separately and then joining or merging that data at the application layer. This method, while simple, may introduce latency due to the need for multiple query executions and data transfers. Alternatively, cross-database query engines or middleware solutions can automate this process by treating multiple databases as a single entity, retrieving data from both simultaneously.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Query Federation</strong> is a more advanced technique where a single query is distributed across multiple databases, with the system automatically handling the retrieval and merging of data. This method allows for more seamless integration between databases, enabling a unified view of data spread across systems. In a PostgreSQL and SurrealDB hybrid architecture, query federation could involve a middleware layer that translates a SQL query into multiple queries, sending one to PostgreSQL for structured data and another to SurrealDB for more flexible document or graph data, and then merging the results.
</p>

## 13.4.2 Optimizing Cross-Database Queries
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Cross-database queries can introduce significant performance challenges, particularly in terms of latency and query efficiency. Optimizing these queries requires careful planning, particularly when managing large datasets across different systems like PostgreSQL and SurrealDB.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One optimization technique is <strong>indexing</strong>, which plays a critical role in improving query performance. In PostgreSQL, indexing strategies such as B-tree or hash indexes help speed up the retrieval of structured data, while in SurrealDB, document-based or graph-specific indexes can ensure fast querying of unstructured or graph data. Indexes should be carefully selected based on the type of data being queried in each system and the expected query patterns.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Query planning</strong> is another crucial component of optimization. When querying across databases, it is essential to reduce the number of redundant queries and ensure that data transfers between systems are minimized. Query planners, either built into the databases or implemented at the application layer, can help identify efficient query paths and optimize how data is retrieved from each system.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another critical factor is managing <strong>network latency</strong>, particularly when databases are distributed across different locations or when there is a high volume of data transfer between systems. To address this, caching frequently queried data can reduce the load on the databases and improve response times.
</p>

## 13.4.3 Ensuring Query Consistency
<p style="text-align: justify;">
When querying across multiple databases, ensuring consistency in the results can be challenging, particularly when each system may have different transaction and consistency models. In PostgreSQL, strict ACID properties ensure that transactions are processed consistently, while SurrealDB might rely on eventual consistency in some cases, especially in distributed environments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Query consistency</strong> can be maintained by implementing synchronization mechanisms that ensure both databases reflect the latest data before a query is executed. For example, before executing a cross-database query that involves both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB, the system can verify that any recent updates have been propagated to both databases to ensure the query results are accurate and up-to-date.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One approach to ensure consistency is using <strong>distributed transactions</strong> or <strong>two-phase commits</strong> that span across both databases. These mechanisms ensure that changes in one system are reflected in the other before a query is executed. While these techniques can guarantee strong consistency, they may introduce additional complexity and latency. For less critical data, eventual consistency models might be acceptable, provided that any discrepancies between the systems are handled gracefully.
</p>

## 13.4.4 Writing and Executing Cross-Database Queries
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In practice, writing and executing cross-database queries requires a deep understanding of both PostgreSQL and SurrealDBâ€™s querying mechanisms. Below are practical examples of how to write cross-database queries, along with techniques for optimizing performance and ensuring consistency.
</p>

### Example 1: Simple Cross-Database Query
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, an application retrieves user information from PostgreSQL and their associated social connections from SurrealDB. First, a query is executed in PostgreSQL to get the user data:
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql">}}
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = '12345';
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Next, a query is executed in SurrealDB to retrieve the userâ€™s connections from a graph structure:
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql">}}
SELECT * FROM friends WHERE person1 = '12345';
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
At the application layer, the results from both queries are merged to provide a comprehensive view of the user and their connections.
</p>

### Example 2: Query Federation Example
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Using a middleware layer that supports query federation, a single query is written in SQL that is automatically split into two parts: one sent to PostgreSQL and the other to SurrealDB. The middleware handles the execution of both queries and merges the results:
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql">}}
SELECT users.name, friends.person2 
FROM users JOIN friends ON users.user_id = friends.person1 WHERE users.user_id = '12345';
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This query retrieves the userâ€™s name from PostgreSQL and their friends from SurrealDB, with the results combined and returned as a single response.
</p>

### Example 3: Optimizing Performance with Caching
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To optimize performance, caching can be implemented for frequently queried data. For instance, user profile data from PostgreSQL and connection data from SurrealDB can be stored in a cache, reducing the need for repeated cross-database queries. When a query is made, the system first checks the cache, and only if the data is not present does it query the databases.
</p>

# 13.5 Handling Transactions in a Hybrid System
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Managing transactions in a hybrid database system that incorporates both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB presents unique challenges and opportunities. This section explores the intricacies of ensuring transactional integrity across different databases, introduces the concept of distributed transactions, and offers practical guidance on implementing effective transaction management strategies.
</p>

### 13.5.1 Transactional Integrity Across Databases
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Maintaining transactional integrity in a hybrid system requires ensuring that operations across both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB adhere to the principles of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability). Each database system has its own transaction management capabilities, which can complicate maintaining consistency.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Challenges of Transactional Integrity</strong>: The primary challenge is to ensure that a transaction that spans both databases either fully completes or rolls back without leaving the system in an inconsistent state. This challenge is heightened by the differences in how PostgreSQL and SurrealDB handle transactions.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Atomicity</strong>: Ensuring that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully or none are applied. This requires coordination between the two databases to achieve a consistent state.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Consistency</strong>: Maintaining data integrity and ensuring that all database constraints and rules are enforced.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Isolation</strong>: Managing concurrent transactions to avoid interference and ensure data consistency.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Durability</strong>: Ensuring that once a transaction is committed, it is permanent and survives system failures.</p>
### 13.5.2 Distributed Transactions
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Distributed transactions</strong> are a crucial mechanism in hybrid systems, as they allow transactions to span multiple databases and ensure that all operations either commit or rollback in unison. These transactions are typically managed through a protocol known as the <strong>two-phase commit (2PC)</strong>, which ensures that each participating database agrees to either commit or abort the transaction before it is finalized. In the first phase, the coordinator asks each database (in this case, PostgreSQL and SurrealDB) if they are ready to commit. If all participants agree, the second phase is initiated, where the commit is executed. If any participant signals a failure, a rollback is triggered across all databases.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
While 2PC guarantees consistency, it introduces latency and complexity, particularly in distributed systems where network failures or system crashes can occur. In practice, it may be necessary to weigh the cost of 2PC against performance requirements, particularly in scenarios where strict consistency is not essential and eventual consistency can be tolerated.
</p>

## 13.5.3 Conflict Resolution in Hybrid Transactions
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Conflict resolution</strong> becomes a significant concern in hybrid systems where data may be written to multiple databases simultaneously. For example, if PostgreSQL processes a financial transaction and SurrealDB updates related user interactions at the same time, discrepancies may arise if both systems cannot commit simultaneously due to a failure in one database.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Strategies for resolving such conflicts include implementing <strong>retry mechanisms</strong> that attempt to re-execute failed transactions or employing <strong>version control techniques</strong> that allow different versions of data to coexist until reconciliation can be achieved. In some cases, it might be necessary to designate one system (such as PostgreSQL) as the <strong>source of truth</strong> for critical transactional data, while SurrealDB is used for data that can tolerate eventual consistency.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For hybrid systems where conflicts must be minimized, <strong>application-level reconciliation logic</strong> can be built to resolve discrepancies after a transaction. This might involve automated checks that identify out-of-sync data between PostgreSQL and SurrealDB and attempt to correct inconsistencies based on pre-defined rules.
</p>

## 13.5.4 Isolation Levels in Hybrid Systems
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Isolation levels</strong> control how visible a transaction's changes are to other concurrent transactions, and in a hybrid system, they play a critical role in balancing consistency and performance. PostgreSQL offers several isolation levels, including <strong>READ COMMITTED</strong>, <strong>REPEATABLE READ</strong>, and <strong>SERIALIZABLE</strong>, each with increasing levels of transaction isolation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In contrast, SurrealDBâ€™s isolation mechanisms may differ, particularly when dealing with graph or document-based models where eventual consistency might be acceptable. The challenge in a hybrid system is ensuring that isolation levels across databases are aligned in a way that provides sufficient consistency without degrading performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For example, in scenarios where strong consistency is essential, such as financial transactions, <strong>SERIALIZABLE isolation</strong> may be applied across both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB. In contrast, for less critical operations, <strong>READ COMMITTED</strong> isolation might be sufficient, allowing for more relaxed consistency in exchange for improved performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The key is to determine the right <strong>balance between isolation and performance</strong>, depending on the nature of the transactions and the criticality of the data involved. In hybrid systems, it is often necessary to adopt a flexible approach where different isolation levels are applied based on specific transactional needs.
</p>

## 13.5.5 Implementing Distributed Transactions
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing distributed transactions in a hybrid system that spans both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB requires a deep understanding of transaction management and coordination between systems. The <strong>two-phase commit protocol</strong> is the most common method for ensuring that all participating databases either commit or rollback together, but there are practical steps involved in ensuring that this process works efficiently.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To begin, each transaction in PostgreSQL and SurrealDB must be coordinated through a <strong>transaction manager</strong> or <strong>middleware layer</strong> that can handle the distributed nature of the transaction. The manager initiates the first phase of the 2PC, where it asks both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB if they are prepared to commit. Each system prepares the transaction and reports back whether it can commit. If both systems report readiness, the second phase begins, and the transaction is committed across both databases. If either system fails, the manager instructs both databases to rollback, ensuring that no partial updates occur.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For example, consider a transaction where an order is processed in PostgreSQL, and the customerâ€™s interaction history is updated in SurrealDB. The two-phase commit process would ensure that either both the order and the interaction history are committed, or neither of them are, preventing any inconsistencies between the two systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In cases where a transaction must be <strong>rolled back</strong>, the distributed system must ensure that both databases return to their previous states. PostgreSQLâ€™s rollback mechanisms are well established, but in SurrealDB, additional care might be needed to ensure that rollback operations correctly undo any changes made to graph or document-based data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally, <strong>recovery mechanisms</strong> should be implemented to handle failures that occur during the commit process. These mechanisms might involve logging incomplete transactions and retrying the operation once the systems are back online, ensuring that transactional integrity is maintained even in the face of system failures.
</p>

# 13.6 Monitoring and Maintaining the Hybrid System
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Monitoring and maintaining a hybrid database system is a crucial ongoing process that ensures optimal performance, uptime, and data integrity. With databases as different as PostgreSQL and SurrealDB, it is essential to use specialized tools, apply proactive strategies, and implement automated processes for long-term stability. This section covers the necessary tools, strategies for proactive monitoring, long-term maintenance considerations, and practical guides for setting up dashboards and automating maintenance tasks.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Custom APIs</strong>: To monitor performance specific to document, graph, and relational data models.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SurrealQL Queries</strong>: For tracking query execution times, graph traversals, and document read/write operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Key metrics to track in both databases include query latency, resource utilization (CPU, memory), disk usage, and the frequency of slow queries. By gathering this data, database administrators can identify performance bottlenecks and areas requiring optimization.
</p>

## 13.6.2 Maintenance Strategies
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To keep a hybrid system running smoothly, regular maintenance practices must be followed, including updates, backups, and scaling.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>System Updates</strong>: Regularly applying updates and patches is critical to ensure compatibility and security. Schedule rolling updates to avoid downtime while keeping both databases in sync.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Backup Strategies</strong>:</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PostgreSQL</strong>: Use tools like <strong>pg_dump</strong> and <strong>pgBackRest</strong> for consistent and efficient backups.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SurrealDB</strong>: Implement custom backup solutions to manage its multi-model data, ensuring that documents, graphs, and other models can be recovered seamlessly.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Scaling</strong>: Ensure that the system can scale as data volumes increase:</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PostgreSQL</strong>: Can be scaled vertically (increasing system resources) or horizontally (using replication or sharding).</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SurrealDB</strong>: Needs a flexible approach to handle growing data models, distributing workloads more efficiently across nodes.</p>
## 13.6.3 Proactive Monitoring and Alerts
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Proactive monitoring allows you to catch issues before they affect the system's performance or availability. Setting up real-time alerts based on predefined thresholds ensures timely intervention.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Critical Alert Thresholds</strong>:</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disk usage</strong>: Set alerts when disk space usage approaches dangerous levels.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Slow queries</strong>: Monitor query execution times, and trigger alerts when queries take longer than expected.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Resource exhaustion</strong>: Detect when CPU or memory usage is abnormally high, indicating potential performance bottlenecks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Tools like <strong>Prometheus</strong> and <strong>Grafana</strong> allow you to create real-time dashboards and configure custom alerts. These tools provide valuable insights into the health of both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB, ensuring any issues are addressed before they escalate into system failures.
</p>

## 13.6.4 Long-Term Maintenance Considerations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Maintaining a hybrid database system over time requires planning for evolving software versions, changing data needs, and ensuring compatibility between PostgreSQL and SurrealDB.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Version Compatibility</strong>: PostgreSQL and SurrealDB updates may introduce features that need testing for compatibility. Always test in staging environments before applying updates in production to prevent disruption.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Evolving Data Requirements</strong>: As the system grows, the nature of the data stored in each database may change, requiring adjustments to the schema, indexing strategies, and overall database design.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Integrity Checks</strong>: Long-term maintenance should include regular checks to ensure that data remains consistent across both databases. Any discrepancies should be identified and resolved through reconciliation processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Regular audits, consistency checks, and performance tuning will keep the hybrid system robust and responsive to changing business requirements.
</p>

## 13.6.5 Setting Up a Monitoring Dashboard
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Setting up a centralized dashboard is key to visualizing the performance and health of your hybrid database system in real time. This dashboard should provide critical insights into both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB.
</p>

### Steps to Set Up a Monitoring Dashboard:
1. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Select Monitoring Tools<strong></strong>: Use <strong></strong>Grafana<strong></strong> for visualizations and <strong></strong>Prometheus<strong></strong> for gathering metrics from both databases.</p>
2. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Integrate PostgreSQL Metrics<strong></strong>: Use <strong></strong>Prometheus exporters<strong></strong> to track PostgreSQL performance (query execution, memory usage, etc.).</p>
3. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Integrate SurrealDB Metrics<strong></strong>: Build custom APIs to feed SurrealDB performance data into the same dashboard, including document read/write operations and graph traversal speeds.</p>
4. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Create Visualizations<strong></strong>: Design graphs, charts, and alerts for key performance indicators such as query response times, CPU usage, and disk utilization.</p>
5. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Set Alerts<strong></strong>: Configure alerts to notify administrators when performance thresholds are exceeded or when errors occur.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A well-configured dashboard enables quick identification of problems and allows for faster decision-making.
</p>

## 13.6.6 Implementing Automated Maintenance Tasks
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Automating routine maintenance tasks helps prevent human error and ensures that essential processes like backups, data checks, and scaling happen without manual intervention.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Automated Backups</strong>:</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PostgreSQL</strong>: Set up scheduled backups using <strong>pgBackRest</strong> or <strong>Barman</strong>, ensuring that all critical data is regularly backed up.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SurrealDB</strong>: Develop custom scripts to automate backups of document and graph data, scheduling these backups to run during low-traffic periods.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Integrity Checks</strong>: Automate integrity checks to verify that data remains consistent between PostgreSQL and SurrealDB. This can be done by running scheduled comparison scripts that check for discrepancies.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Scaling Automation</strong>: Implement dynamic scaling solutions where system resources (e.g., CPU, memory) are automatically increased as data and workload demands grow. This can involve auto-scaling cloud infrastructure based on predefined resource usage thresholds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Automation not only reduces manual workload but also ensures that critical tasks are executed on time, safeguarding the integrity and performance of the hybrid database system.
</p>

# 13.7 Practical Implementation on Integrating PostgreSQL and SurrealDB
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To enable data synchronization between PostgreSQL and SurrealDB, PostgreSQL must be configured to support replication. This involves modifying configuration files to allow replication connections and setting up necessary parameters.
</p>

1. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Edit<strong></strong> <code>postgresql.conf</code></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Locate the <code>postgresql.conf</code> file, typically found in the PostgreSQL data directory (e.g., <code>/etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf</code> on Linux systems or <code>C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\data\postgresql.conf</code> on Windows). Open the file in a text editor and modify the following settings to enable logical replication:
</p>

{{< prism lang="">}}
   listen_addresses = '*'
   wal_level = logical
   max_replication_slots = 4
   max_wal_senders = 4
{{< /prism >}}
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>listen_addresses = '*'</code>: Allows PostgreSQL to listen for connections on all available IP addresses.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>wal_level = logical</code>: Sets the Write-Ahead Logging level to support logical replication.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>max_replication_slots = 4</code>: Specifies the maximum number of replication slots.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>max_wal_senders = 4</code>: Defines the maximum number of concurrent WAL sender processes.</p>
2. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Edit<strong></strong> <code>pg_hba.conf</code></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The <code>pg_hba.conf</code> file controls client authentication. Update this file to allow replication connections from SurrealDB. Add the following line, replacing <code><surrealdb_ip></code> with the actual IP address of the SurrealDB server:
</p>

{{< prism lang="">}}
   host    replication     all             <surrealdb_ip>/32          md5
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This line permits replication connections from the specified IP address using MD5 password authentication.
</p>

3. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Restart PostgreSQL<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
After making these changes, apply them by restarting PostgreSQL. On Windows, you can use the following command in the Command Prompt:
</p>

{{< prism lang="shell">}}
   net stop postgresql-x64-14
   net start postgresql-x64-14
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
For Linux systems, use:
</p>

{{< prism lang="shell">}}
   sudo systemctl restart postgresql
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
SurrealDB must be prepared to accept replication data from PostgreSQL. This involves enabling replication features and configuring network and authentication settings.
</p>

1. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Enable Replication Features<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Depending on the SurrealDB version and deployment method, enable replication features by configuring the necessary settings. Refer to the SurrealDB documentation for specific instructions related to replication configuration.
</p>

2. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Network Configuration<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Ensure that SurrealDB is accessible over the network. Verify that the WebSocket port (default is <code>8000</code>) is open and not blocked by firewalls. Adjust firewall settings as needed to allow incoming connections on this port.
</p>

3. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Authentication Setup<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Secure replication connections by configuring authentication credentials in SurrealDB. Typically, this involves setting up API keys or user credentials that PostgreSQL will use to authenticate when sending data. For example, use the following Rust code snippet to establish a secure connection:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
   use surrealdb::Surreal;
   use surrealdb::engine::remote::ws::Ws;
   
   async fn connect_surrealdb() -> Result<Surreal<Ws>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
       let db = Surreal::new::<Ws>("ws://localhost:8000/rpc").await?;
       db.signin(surrealdb::opt::auth::Key {
           username: "root",
           password: "root",
       }).await?;
       db.use_ns("ecommerce").use_db("main").await?;
       Ok(db)
   }
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Replace <code>"root"</code> and <code>"root"</code> with secure credentials as appropriate for your deployment.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
With both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB configured for replication, the next step is to initialize SurrealDB with existing data from PostgreSQL. This ensures that both databases start with consistent data sets, facilitating effective synchronization.
</p>

1. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Export Data from PostgreSQL<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Utilize the <code>pg_dump</code> utility to export the desired tables from PostgreSQL. For instance, to export the <code>orders</code> and <code>order_items</code> tables, execute the following command:
</p>

{{< prism lang="shell">}}
   pg_dump -U postgres -h localhost -d ecommerce -t orders -t order_items -F c -b -v -f orders_backup.dump
{{< /prism >}}
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>-U postgres</code>: Specifies the PostgreSQL user.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>-h localhost</code>: Indicates the host.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>-d ecommerce</code>: Names the database to dump.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>-t orders -t order_items</code>: Specifies the tables to export.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>-F c</code>: Sets the output format to custom.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>-b</code>: Includes large objects.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>-v</code>: Enables verbose mode.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><code>-f orders_backup.dump</code>: Names the output file.</p>
2. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Import Data into SurrealDB<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
SurrealDB requires data to be in a compatible format for ingestion. Convert the exported data to JSON or another supported format and use SurrealDB's import tools or APIs to ingest the data. Below is an example Rust script to import data into SurrealDB:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
   use surrealdb::Surreal;
   use surrealdb::engine::remote::ws::Ws;
   use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
   use std::fs::File;
   use std::io::BufReader;
   
   #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   struct Order {
       id: i32,
       user_id: i32,
       order_date: String,
       total_amount: f32,
   }
   
   async fn import_orders(db: &Surreal<Ws>, filepath: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
       let file = File::open(filepath)?;
       let reader = BufReader::new(file);
       let orders: Vec<Order> = serde_json::from_reader(reader)?;
   
       for order in orders {
           db.create(("orders", order.id.to_string()))
               .content(order)
               .await?;
       }
       Ok(())
   }
   
   #[tokio::main]
   async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
       let db = Surreal::new::<Ws>("ws://localhost:8000/rpc").await?;
       db.signin(surrealdb::opt::auth::Key {
           username: "root",
           password: "root",
       }).await?;
       db.use_ns("ecommerce").use_db("main").await?;
   
       import_orders(&db, "orders_backup.json").await?;
       println!("Orders imported successfully.");
   
       Ok(())
   }
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<em>Ensure that the data exported from PostgreSQL is converted to a compatible format (e.g., JSON) that SurrealDB can ingest.</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
With both databases configured and initialized, the next step is to establish connections using Rust. This involves setting up client instances for both PostgreSQL and SurrealDB, enabling seamless communication between them.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Connecting to PostgreSQL</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Use the <code>tokio-postgres</code> crate to establish an asynchronous connection to PostgreSQL:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use tokio_postgres::{NoTls, Error};

async fn connect_postgres() -> Result<tokio_postgres::Client, Error> {
    let conn_str = "host=localhost user=postgres password=password dbname=ecommerce";
    let (client, connection) = tokio_postgres::connect(conn_str, NoTls).await?;

    tokio::spawn(async move {
        if let Err(e) = connection.await {
            eprintln!("PostgreSQL connection error: {}", e);
        }
    });

    Ok(client)
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This function establishes a connection to PostgreSQL and spawns a background task to manage the connection lifecycle, ensuring that the client remains responsive.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Connecting to SurrealDB</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Use the <code>surrealdb</code> crate to establish a connection to SurrealDB:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use surrealdb::Surreal;
use surrealdb::engine::remote::ws::Ws;

async fn connect_surrealdb() -> Result<Surreal<Ws>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let db = Surreal::new::<Ws>("ws://localhost:8000/rpc").await?;
    db.signin(surrealdb::opt::auth::Key {
        username: "root",
        password: "root",
    }).await?;
    db.use_ns("ecommerce").use_db("main").await?;
    Ok(db)
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This function connects to SurrealDB via WebSocket, authenticates using the provided credentials, and selects the appropriate namespace and database for operations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Integrating Connections</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Combine both connections in the main function to prepare for data synchronization:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let pg_client = connect_postgres().await?;
    let surreal_db = connect_surrealdb().await?;

    // Proceed with synchronization
    Ok(())
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This setup ensures that both database connections are established and ready for synchronization tasks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Before implementing full-scale synchronization, perform simple tests to verify that PostgreSQL and SurrealDB communicate correctly. This involves inserting sample data into PostgreSQL and verifying its replication in SurrealDB.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Inserting Sample Data into PostgreSQL</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
First, insert a sample order into the <code>orders</code> table in PostgreSQL. Use the following SQL command:
</p>

{{< prism lang="">}}
INSERT INTO orders (id, user_id, order_date, total_amount)
VALUES (1, 101, '2024-04-25', 299.99);
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This command adds a new order with specific details, serving as a test case for synchronization.
</p>
