<p style="text-align: justify;">  
Part I of <em>MMDR: Multi-Model Databases with Rust</em> lays the foundational knowledge necessary to understand multi-model databases by starting with a conceptual overview of these versatile systems, discussing their benefits, and why they represent a significant evolution in database technology. This section explores the importance of a robust development environment, including the setup of Rust and essential tools like Diesel, a primary crate for PostgreSQL, emphasizing Rustâ€™s growing role in database management.  
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">  
<strong>Chapter 1: Understanding Multi-Model Databases</strong> introduces the concept and advantages of multi-model databases. <strong>Chapter 2: Environment Setup</strong> guides you through the installation of Rust, Diesel, and database prerequisites to prepare you for the hands-on experiences in subsequent chapters.  
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">  
To gain the most from Part I, begin by exploring the conceptual overview provided in the first chapter, which offers insights into the versatility and strategic advantages of multi-model databases. Then, delve into the second chapter with a practical mindset, setting up your Rust environment and learning about Diesel to prepare for hands-on experiences in subsequent chapters. This foundational knowledge sets the stage for more advanced topics in database operations and Rustâ€™s application in this field. Engage actively with the content: experiment with different database models, apply the initial setups, and explore how Rustâ€™s safety and efficiency enhance database operations.
