The impact of complex transactions on performance and scalability cannot be underestimated. As applications grow and the volume of data increases, the efficiency of these operations becomes critical. Poorly designed transactions can lead to bottlenecks, slow response times, and resource contention, which can severely affect user experience. Therefore, it is vital to adopt practical implementation strategies that minimize these risks. This section will explore techniques such as batching updates, leveraging indexes for quicker access, and using asynchronous processing to improve the performance of advanced CRUD operations in SurrealDB. By mastering these advanced techniques, developers can ensure that their applications are capable of scaling effectively while providing seamless and efficient data interactions across various models.
</p>

## **10.6.1 Complex Transactions**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Handling complex transactions in SurrealDB often requires managing multiple operations across different data models. This can include executing atomic operations that affect both document, graph, and relational models within a single transaction.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Multi-Model Transactions</strong>: SurrealDB supports complex transactions that span multiple data models. For example, a transaction might involve updating a document, creating a new relationship in a graph, and inserting a row into a relational tableâ€”all as part of a single atomic operation.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Transaction Example</strong>: Suppose you want to transfer funds between accounts and update related graphs and records:</p>
{{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = '12345';
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = '67890';
  
  INSERT INTO transactions (from_account, to_account, amount) VALUES ('12345', '67890', 100);
  
  COMMIT;
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Error Handling</strong>: Ensure that transactions are robust by implementing error handling and rollback mechanisms to maintain data integrity in case of failures.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing advanced CRUD scenarios in SurrealDB involves leveraging its multi-model capabilities to handle bulk operations, conditional updates, and other complex use cases.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Bulk Operations</strong>: Performing bulk insertions, updates, or deletions can optimize throughput and reduce the number of individual operations.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bulk Insert Example</strong>: Insert multiple documents in one command:</p>
{{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
  INSERT INTO users (user_id, name, email) VALUES 
    ('001', 'Alice', 'alice@example.com'),
    ('002', 'Bob', 'bob@example.com'),
    ('003', 'Charlie', 'charlie@example.com');
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Conditional Updates</strong>: Applying updates based on specific conditions can optimize data manipulation and ensure only relevant records are affected.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conditional Update Example</strong>: Update records based on certain criteria:</p>
{{< prism lang="sql">}}
  UPDATE accounts SET status = 'inactive' WHERE last_login < '2023-01-01';
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Multi-Model Transactions</strong>: Combine operations across different data models in a single transaction to maintain consistency and integrity.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: Transfer a documentâ€™s attribute, update a graph relationship, and modify relational data:</p>
{{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  
  UPDATE documents SET status = 'archived' WHERE doc_id = '98765';
  DELETE FROM graph_relationships WHERE source_id = '98765';
  
  INSERT INTO audit_logs (event, timestamp) VALUES ('Document Archived', '2024-09-17T12:34:56Z');
  
  COMMIT;
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
