</p>

# **9.2 Basic Configuration**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
After successfully installing SurrealDB, the next step is configuring it to meet your specific needs. The database offers several configuration options, allowing you to tailor settings such as network behavior, storage paths, and security measures. Proper configuration not only ensures optimal performance but also enhances security and scalability, especially as your application grows in complexity. In this section, weâ€™ll introduce SurrealDBâ€™s configuration files, cover the key initial settings, and explore how to optimize configurations for different environments.
</p>

## **9.2.1 Configuration Files**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
SurrealDBâ€™s configuration is managed through a set of files that allow you to define the databaseâ€™s behavior, including network options, storage, and security policies. Understanding how to work with these files is crucial to controlling how SurrealDB operates in different environments, such as development, testing, or production.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>surreal.toml</strong>: This is the primary configuration file where most of the database's settings are defined. The file is structured using the TOML (Tomâ€™s Obvious, Minimal Language) format, making it easy to read and modify.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Key sections in <code>surreal.toml</code> include:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>network</strong>: Defines network options such as the IP address and port on which SurrealDB listens.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>storage</strong>: Specifies where and how SurrealDB stores data, including file paths for local storage or connections to external storage systems.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>security</strong>: Manages security options like authentication methods, role-based access control (RBAC), and SSL/TLS settings for secure communication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
You can create or edit the configuration file before starting the SurrealDB server to customize its behavior.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of a <code>surreal.toml</code> file:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
[network]
bind = "127.0.0.1:8000"   # Network binding for SurrealDB

[storage]
path = "./data"           # Path to the local storage directory

[security]
tls = false               # Whether to use TLS for connections
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
SurrealDB loads this configuration file when it starts, and the settings within it dictate how the database interacts with the system and other services.
</p>

## **9.2.2 Initial Settings**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
There are several essential settings in the configuration file that you need to adjust based on your specific environment. These settings will determine how SurrealDB connects to the network, where it stores its data, and how secure the connections are.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Network Options</strong>: The <code>network</code> section controls how SurrealDB listens for incoming connections. By default, the database binds to <code>127.0.0.1:8000</code>, which restricts access to localhost. For production environments, you might want to bind the database to a specific external IP address or use a different port.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of configuring the network settings for external access:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
  [network]
  bind = "0.0.0.0:8000"  # Allows SurrealDB to accept connections from any IP address
  
{{< /prism >}}
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Storage Paths</strong>: The <code>storage</code> section defines where SurrealDB stores its data. By default, the data is stored locally in a specified directory. You can also configure SurrealDB to use remote storage solutions (such as cloud services or network-attached storage) depending on your scalability and backup needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of local storage configuration:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
  [storage]
  path = "./my_data"  # Set the storage directory to a custom folder
  
{{< /prism >}}
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Settings</strong>: Security is crucial when configuring a database, especially for production environments. The <code>security</code> section in the configuration file controls whether SSL/TLS is used to encrypt connections, as well as settings for authentication and access control. In development, you might disable these features, but for production, enabling TLS and authentication is critical to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of enabling TLS for secure connections:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
  [security]
  tls = true                 # Enable TLS for secure communication
  cert_file = "/path/to/cert.pem"  # Path to the SSL certificate
  key_file = "/path/to/key.pem"    # Path to the SSL private key
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By properly configuring these initial settings, you ensure that SurrealDB operates securely and efficiently, tailored to your environmentâ€™s specific needs.
</p>

## **9.2.3 Optimizing Initial Setup**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The configuration settings you choose can have a significant impact on the performance and security of your SurrealDB instance. Optimizing these settings early in the process ensures that the database performs well and scales as needed without compromising security.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Network Optimization</strong>: In production environments, limiting network access to specific IP addresses can help reduce the attack surface of the database. Instead of allowing connections from any IP, you can restrict SurrealDB to only accept traffic from trusted sources (such as your application server or internal network).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of restricted network access:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
  [network]
  bind = "192.168.1.10:8000"  # Only allow connections from the internal network
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Additionally, setting a high timeout value for inactive connections can prevent excessive resource usage, especially in environments where many clients connect and disconnect frequently.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Storage Optimization</strong>: Choosing the right storage option is vital for both performance and scalability. For local development, storing data on the local filesystem is fine. However, for production use, you may want to connect SurrealDB to distributed or cloud-based storage systems like Amazon S3 or a distributed file system (such as Ceph) for better redundancy and scalability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of connecting to a cloud-based storage system:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
  [storage]
  backend = "aws_s3"
  bucket = "my-surrealdb-backup"
  region = "us-east-1"
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Optimizing storage paths can also improve read/write performance by splitting data across multiple disks or nodes, especially in high-volume environments.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Security Optimization</strong>: In development, you might disable security features to focus on building your application. However, in production, it is crucial to enable SSL/TLS encryption and set up proper authentication mechanisms. Role-based access control (RBAC) allows you to define specific roles with limited permissions, ensuring that users only have access to the data and actions they need.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of using role-based access control:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
  [security]
  enable_rbac = true   # Enable role-based access control
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Setting up logging and monitoring is also recommended to track access attempts, audit changes, and identify potential security risks. Integrating tools like <strong>Prometheus</strong> for metrics collection and <strong>Grafana</strong> for visualization can help monitor the health and security of your SurrealDB instance in real-time.
</p>

## **9.2.4 Configuring for Different Scenarios**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Different scenarios require different configurations, especially when moving from development to production or when setting up a testing environment. Letâ€™s explore how to configure SurrealDB for various environments to get the best performance and security.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Development Environment</strong>: In development, simplicity and flexibility are key. You can use minimal security, local storage, and lower resource constraints to focus on rapid development and testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
  [network]
  bind = "127.0.0.1:8000"
  
  [storage]
  path = "./dev_data"
  
  [security]
  tls = false  # No need for TLS in development
  
{{< /prism >}}
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Testing Environment</strong>: For testing, youâ€™ll want to simulate a production-like setup, but it can run on smaller hardware or virtual machines. Some security and performance settings may be relaxed, but the configuration should still reflect the intended production environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
  [network]
  bind = "127.0.0.1:8000"
  
  [storage]
  path = "./test_data"
  
  [security]
  tls = true  # Test secure connections
  
{{< /prism >}}
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Production Environment</strong>: In production, performance, security, and high availability are essential. The configuration should be robust, using secure connections, external storage, and clustering for high availability. Load balancing and monitoring tools should also be integrated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
  [network]
  bind = "0.0.0.0:8000"
  
  [storage]
  path = "/mnt/production_storage"
  
  [security]
  tls = true
  cert_file = "/etc/ssl/certs/surrealdb.pem"
  key_file = "/etc/ssl/private/surrealdb-key.pem"
  
  [monitoring]
  enable_prometheus = true
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By following these configurations for different environments, you can ensure that SurrealDB operates efficiently and securely, tailored to the specific requirements of each stage in your development lifecycle.
</p>

# **9.3 User Management and Security**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
User management and security are critical components of database administration, especially for multi-model databases like SurrealDB, where diverse data models are integrated into a single system. Implementing robust security measures ensures that the database is protected against unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse, particularly in production environments. This section will cover how to create user accounts, assign roles and permissions, and discuss security best practices, including authentication, encryption, and access control.
</p>

## **9.3.1 Creating Users**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the first steps in securing any database is setting up appropriate user accounts and assigning the correct roles and permissions. SurrealDB supports role-based access control (RBAC), allowing administrators to define specific roles for users and restrict their access based on their responsibilities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Steps for creating user accounts</strong>:
</p>

1. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Define roles<strong></strong>: Before creating users, you need to define the roles that users will have. Roles determine what actions users can perform and what data they can access.</p>
2. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Create users<strong></strong>: After defining roles, create individual user accounts and assign them to the appropriate roles.</p>
3. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Assign permissions<strong></strong>: Permissions define the specific actions that a user can take within a database, such as reading data, writing to tables, or performing administrative tasks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of creating a user in SurrealDB:
</p>

{{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
CREATE USER admin_user
    SET PASSWORD 'securepassword'
    ROLES admin;
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, a user <code>admin_user</code> is created with the password <code>securepassword</code> and assigned the <code>admin</code> role. The admin role may have full access to all database operations, including reading, writing, and modifying schema. You can create multiple roles, such as <code>read-only</code> or <code>data-entry</code>, to limit access for non-administrative users.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Best practices for creating users</strong>:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Use strong passwords</strong>: Ensure that all user accounts are created with strong passwords. SurrealDB should enforce password complexity rules to prevent weak passwords from being used.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Limit privileges</strong>: Only grant users the minimum permissions required for their tasks. This reduces the risk of accidental or malicious changes to the database.</p>
## **9.3.2 Security Best Practices**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Securing a database is not just about setting up users and roles; it involves a comprehensive approach that includes encryption, authentication, and monitoring. Below are key best practices for securing your SurrealDB instance.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Authentication</strong>: Enforcing authentication mechanisms ensures that only authorized users can access the database. In SurrealDB, you can enforce password-based authentication for users or integrate with external authentication systems, such as LDAP or OAuth, for centralized user management.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Password Management</strong>: Passwords should be securely stored and managed. Ensure that passwords are hashed using strong algorithms and that SurrealDB is configured to reject weak passwords. Enforce password expiration policies to ensure that users change their passwords periodically.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Access Control</strong>: Access control is achieved through role-based permissions. By assigning users to roles with specific privileges, you can control who has access to sensitive data or critical operations. Use the principle of <strong>least privilege</strong>, ensuring that users are only given the permissions necessary for their tasks.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Encryption</strong>:</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Encryption</strong>: Encrypting data at rest and in transit is essential for preventing unauthorized access. SurrealDB supports TLS/SSL to encrypt connections between the client and the database, ensuring that data is not exposed during transmission.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TLS/SSL Configuration</strong>: Always enable TLS/SSL encryption in production environments to secure communications between your application and SurrealDB.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of enabling TLS:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
[security]
tls = true
cert_file = "/path/to/ssl/cert.pem"
key_file = "/path/to/ssl/key.pem"
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By enabling TLS, you ensure that all data transmitted between the database and the client is encrypted and protected from potential eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Auditing and Logging</strong>: Keep an audit log of user actions, especially those performed by privileged users. This helps track any unauthorized or suspicious activity and can be critical for detecting breaches or preventing misuse.</p>
## **9.3.3 Importance of Robust Security**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the context of multi-model databases like SurrealDB, security is of paramount importance due to the diverse types of data being stored, which may include highly sensitive information, such as personal data, financial records, or confidential business information. A robust security framework is essential for protecting this data from unauthorized access and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Significance of robust security</strong>:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Sensitivity</strong>: Multi-model databases often store a wide range of data types, from relational records to document-based data, which may include sensitive information. Implementing strict access controls and encryption mechanisms helps protect this data from breaches.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Multi-user Access</strong>: In production environments, multiple users and services often need to access the database simultaneously. Without a strong security model, a compromised user account could give attackers unrestricted access to the database, leading to potential data corruption or leaks.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong>: Many industries, such as healthcare and finance, have strict regulations that require organizations to protect customer data. SurrealDB needs to be configured to comply with these regulations, which often mandate encryption, user authentication, and data retention policies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Security Considerations for Multi-Model Databases</strong>:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Role-based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>: This is crucial in multi-model environments where different data models may require different access levels. For example, while some users might need full access to relational tables, they might only require read-only access to document stores.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Granular Permissions</strong>: In multi-model databases, data can be more complex and interconnected. Itâ€™s important to enforce granular permissions, where users are only given access to the parts of the data they need.</p>
## **9.3.4 Implementing Security Measures**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To effectively secure a SurrealDB instance, administrators need to implement various security measures, including authentication, encryption, and access control. Below is a guide to setting up essential security features.
</p>

<ol>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Setting Up Authentication:</strong>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Ensure that every user is required to authenticate before accessing the database. This can be achieved by creating user accounts with unique credentials and configuring SurrealDB to enforce authentication on all incoming connections.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Example:</p>
        {{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
        CREATE USER read_only_user
            SET PASSWORD 'readonlypass'
            ROLES reader;
        {{< /prism >}}
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Here, a user <code>read_only_user</code> is created with restricted permissions for read-only access.</p>
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enforcing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Assign roles to users based on their responsibilities. For example, developers might need write access to specific tables, while data analysts only require read access.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Example of role assignment:</p>
        {{< prism lang="sql" line-numbers="true">}}
        CREATE ROLE reader;
        GRANT SELECT ON users TO reader;
        {{< /prism >}}
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In this case, a <code>reader</code> role is created and granted <code>SELECT</code> (read) permissions on the <code>users</code> table.</p>
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enabling TLS/SSL for Secure Connections:</strong>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">By default, SurrealDB might allow unencrypted connections, which poses a security risk. Enabling TLS/SSL ensures that all data sent between the client and database is encrypted.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Example of enabling TLS:</p>
        {{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
        [security]
        tls = true
        cert_file = "/path/to/cert.pem"
        key_file = "/path/to/key.pem"
        {{< /prism >}}
        <p style="text-align: justify;">After enabling TLS, SurrealDB will only accept encrypted connections, ensuring that data in transit is protected.</p>
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Auditing and Monitoring:</strong>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Enable logging to capture important actions, such as user logins, failed authentication attempts, and changes to critical data. Tools like <strong>Prometheus</strong> and <strong>Grafana</strong> can be integrated to monitor database health and performance in real-time.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Example of enabling logging:</p>
        {{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
        [logging]
        level = "info"
        path = "/var/log/surrealdb.log"
        {{< /prism >}}
    </li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This configuration enables logging of important database events to a file for later review.
</p>

# **9.4 Preparing for Advanced Usage**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
As applications grow in complexity and scale, preparing your SurrealDB instance for advanced usage becomes crucial. This includes implementing scaling configurations to handle increased load, establishing reliable backup and recovery strategies to protect data, and planning for long-term maintenance and updates. In this section, we will explore the key considerations for scaling SurrealDB, the strategies for ensuring data integrity through backups and disaster recovery, and the importance of maintaining your database installations over time.
</p>

## **9.4.1 Scaling Configurations**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Scaling SurrealDB effectively is essential for accommodating increased workloads and ensuring optimal performance. There are two primary methods for scaling: <strong>clustering</strong> and <strong>load balancing</strong>.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Clustering</strong>: Clustering allows multiple SurrealDB instances to work together, distributing the load among them and providing redundancy. In a clustered environment, data is typically sharded across the different nodes, enabling horizontal scalability. Each node can handle requests independently, reducing the risk of performance bottlenecks and improving fault tolerance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To set up clustering in SurrealDB, you can configure nodes to join a cluster, enabling data replication and sharing across instances. Hereâ€™s a simplified approach to setting up a clustered environment:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example configuration for clustering:
</p>

{{< prism lang="text" line-numbers="true">}}
  [cluster]
  enable = true
  nodes = ["node1:8000", "node2:8000", "node3:8000"]  # List of cluster node addresses
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This configuration allows SurrealDB to operate in a clustered mode, where multiple nodes can share the load and provide redundancy.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Load Balancing</strong>: Load balancing distributes incoming requests across multiple instances of SurrealDB to ensure no single instance is overwhelmed. By using a load balancer (like HAProxy or NGINX), you can route requests based on current load, improving response times and availability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In a production setup, ensure that your load balancer is properly configured to handle failover scenarios. If one instance goes down, the load balancer should reroute requests to the remaining healthy instances.
</p>

## **9.4.2 Backup and Recovery**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing a robust backup and recovery strategy is vital for protecting your data against loss due to hardware failures, accidental deletions, or other unforeseen events. SurrealDB provides tools and options to help you set up backups and ensure data integrity.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Backup Strategies</strong>:</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Full Backups</strong>: Regularly perform full backups of your database. This captures the entire database state, ensuring that you have a complete copy to restore from in case of data loss.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Incremental Backups</strong>: Consider implementing incremental backups that capture only the changes made since the last backup. This approach reduces storage requirements and speeds up the backup process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of initiating a backup in SurrealDB:
</p>

{{< prism lang="shell">}}
  surreal backup --path /backups/mybackup
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This command creates a backup of your database at the specified path.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Testing Recovery Procedures</strong>: Regularly test your backup and recovery procedures to ensure that you can restore data successfully when needed. Itâ€™s essential to verify that your backups are complete and that the restore process works as expected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Example of restoring from a backup:
</p>

{{< prism lang="shell">}}
  surreal restore --path /backups/mybackup
  
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Testing recovery not only verifies the integrity of your backups but also helps your team become familiar with the process, ensuring swift recovery in real situations.
</p>

## **9.4.3 Long-term Maintenance**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Long-term maintenance of your SurrealDB installation involves regular updates and performance tuning. Keeping your database software up to date is critical for security and performance.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Routine Updates</strong>: Regularly check for updates to SurrealDB and apply them to benefit from new features, performance improvements, and security patches. Maintaining an updated environment helps mitigate vulnerabilities and ensures that you have access to the latest functionality.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Performance Monitoring</strong>: Implement monitoring tools to track the performance of your SurrealDB instance. Keep an eye on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as query latency, resource utilization, and error rates. This information can help identify bottlenecks and inform decisions about scaling or optimizing your database configuration.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Documentation and Change Management</strong>: Maintain thorough documentation of your SurrealDB setup, configurations, and changes over time. This documentation can serve as a valuable resource for troubleshooting issues and onboarding new team members.</p>
## **9.4.4 Setting Up Backups**
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To set up regular backups of your SurrealDB instance, consider implementing the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Determine Backup Frequency:</strong>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Decide how often you need to back up your database based on your data's criticality and change frequency. Daily backups might be appropriate for highly dynamic data, while weekly backups may suffice for less frequently updated data.</p>
    </li> 
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choose Backup Location:</strong>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Select a reliable backup location, such as an external storage service (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) or a dedicated backup server. Ensure that the chosen location has sufficient capacity and redundancy to protect against data loss.</p>
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Automate the Backup Process:</strong>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Use cron jobs (on Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows) to automate the backup process. Schedule the backup command to run at off-peak hours to minimize the impact on system performance.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Example cron job entry for daily backups at midnight:</p>
        {{< prism lang="shell">}}
        0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/surreal backup --path /backups/mybackup
        {{< /prism >}}
    </li> 
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Monitor Backup Success:</strong>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Set up monitoring to verify that backups complete successfully. This may include logging the output of backup commands or sending alerts in case of failures.</p>
    </li>  
    <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Regularly Test Restores:</strong>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Periodically test your restore process using your backups to ensure they are functioning correctly. This practice will help you gain confidence in your backup strategy and make sure that you can recover from data loss when necessary.</p>
    </li>
