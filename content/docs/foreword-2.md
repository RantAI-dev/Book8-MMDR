As the Head of the Data Science Center (DSC) at the University of Indonesia, I have witnessed firsthand the transformative advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly within the domain of data management. The evolution of multi-model databases is revolutionizing how we handle diverse data types, providing a unified approach that integrates various data models into a single, cohesive system. This innovation is not only reshaping the landscape of data storage and retrieval but is also driving the development of more efficient, scalable, and adaptable systems. For those venturing into the world of data management, it is crucial to understand that the true potential of multi-model databases lies in both the underlying mathematical frameworks and the selection of the right programming tools for implementation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
For students in the Mathematics faculty, grasping the mathematical foundations of data management is not just importantâ€”it is essential. Concepts such as set theory, graph theory, relational algebra, and probability theory are the cornerstones upon which multi-model databases are built. These mathematical principles enable us to create systems that can efficiently handle complex data operations across different models, whether they involve structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data. Mastering these concepts is key to harnessing the full capabilities of multi-model databases. Yet, beyond the theoretical foundation, the choice of programming language and tools is equally critical in determining how effectively these systems can be implemented and optimized for real-world applications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the realm of modern data management, Rust has emerged as a powerful tool for developing the robust, high-performance systems that multi-model databases require. While languages like Python and Java have long been staples in this field, Rust offers distinct advantages in terms of memory safety, concurrency, and performance. These features are particularly valuable when building systems that must efficiently manage and query vast amounts of data across different models. Rustâ€™s rapidly expanding ecosystem, including specialized crates designed for database management, provides the necessary tools to implement sophisticated multi-model systems while ensuring that they are both reliable and efficient.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
However, it is crucial to remember that the effectiveness of these tools is fundamentally tied to the depth of understanding that underpins their use. Rustâ€™s ability to handle low-level system complexities makes it an ideal choice for developers who are serious about advancing the field of data management. But to truly leverage the power of Rust in multi-model databases, one must first have a strong grasp of the mathematical abstractions and data structures that define this field.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This book, <em>MMDR - Multi-Model Databases with Rust</em>, is crafted to guide you through both the theoretical and practical aspects of multi-model database development. It underscores the importance of a solid mathematical foundation while introducing you to the practical challenges of implementing these databases using Rust. By bridging the gap between high-level mathematical concepts and low-level system implementation, this book offers a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to excel in this domain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I encourage you to approach this book with a deep appreciation for both the mathematics and the technology that drive the evolution of data management. Rust is more than just a programming language; it is a tool that empowers you to build efficient, reliable, and scalable data systems that are integral to modern technology. As you journey through this book, let it inspire you to not only learn but also innovate and contribute to the future of data management technology.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
With a solid mathematical foundation and Rust as your tool, you are well-prepared to tackle the complexities of multi-model database development and make significant contributions to this rapidly advancing field.
